When user shares a label:

  (related: users can also *send* refs to eachother, which means that the recipient
  gets their own copy that is unaffected by future changes made by the original
  owner)

  - all refs under that label get an entry in their shared-to field
    (shared_to decides who can *see* the ref, and holds user-specific labels.

    shared_to: [{
      user_id: '23423',
      can_edit: true|false,
      shared_labels: ['2343', ...]
    }, ... ]

  - If the owner decides to let sharees edit it, then the can_edit field in
    shared_to will be set to "true"
    In that case:
    - sharees can add their own labels (not visible to other sharees unless
      those labels are themselves shared).
    - sharees can make changes to the ref itself, which is reflected to all
      sharees
    - sharees can remove the shared label, but this only affects them, by
      removing the label entry under the shared_labels field of their entry
      in the ref's shared_to field.
    - sharees can delete the ref, but this only removes their entry in then
      shared_to field
    - If the owner deletes the ref, the owner field will be marked null, but
      sharees will be otherwise unafected.
    - If the owner chooses to stop sharing the ref, then a copy of the ref will
      be created for the owner, and the owner will then be removed from the
      old ref.  Sharees can still see the old ref, but any new changes to the
      ref made by the owner do not affect sharees.

  - If the owner decides not to let sharees edit the ref, then:
    - sharees cannot add their own labels
    - sharees cannot make changes to the ref itself
    - sharees can still remove the shared label, but as before, this only them,
      by removing the entry in the shared_labels field of the shared_to entry.
    - sharees can still delete the ref, but as before, this only removes their
      entry in the shared_to field
    - if the owner deletes the ref, the owner field will be marked null,
      but sharees will be otherwise unaffected (and still unable to edit)

  - sharees can make their own copy of a shared ref.  In that case, a copy of
    the shared ref will be made, with the sharee as the owner, and the sharee
    will be removed from the old ref.  The sharee's own copy is not being shared
    so changes made to it are not visible to the old owner or other sharees,
    nor are the changes made by the old owner or other sharees visible to the
    new owner

  - the owner of a ref that is shared sees a shared icon.  Sharees see a
    shared-to icon.  Clicking the icon lets them take share-specific actions,
    like stop-sharing and make-own-copy.
